## Introduction

Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, making it easy to create responsive and attractive web designs. Sass, on the other hand, is a powerful CSS preprocessor that adds features such as variables, nested rules, and mixins, enabling you to write more maintainable and scalable stylesheets.

In this project, you'll build a modern portfolio website while learning how to use Bootstrap 5 and Sass effectively.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For creating responsive layouts and components.
- **Sass (SCSS)**: For writing modular and reusable CSS.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
